## Introduction
The aim of this project is to predict the prices of houses in Bengaluru based on various parameters such as location, size, total square feet, number of bathrooms, etc. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and deployment of the model using Flask.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle: [Bengaluru House Price Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data).

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA and data cleaning are performed in bhp.ipynb file, it contains the steps for understanding the data, handling missing values, and preparing the data for model training.

## Model Training
Various regression algorithms are used and evaluated to select the best-performing model using GridSearchCV.

## Client-Side Development
The client-side of the application is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in VSCode.
